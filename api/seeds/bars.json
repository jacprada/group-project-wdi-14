      "description": "Set atop the ME London hotel, Radio bar — so called because it’s on the site of the old Marconi House — is a sleek asymmetric treat for the eyes in itself. But naturally it’s the stunning panoramic views across pretty much the whole city that you’ll be looking at.",

      "description": "This characterful pub just off Tottenham Court Road has something special up its sleeve — a rooftop beer garden. It may not be the greenest of gardens, but it’s a pretty sweet spot for a pint in the sunshine all the same.",

      "description": "A great spot to know about, this slick cocktail sanctuary high above Regent Street — part of Aqua Kyoto restaurant — is in a prime position for post-shopping recuperation. The views over Oxford Street and the West End are as appealing as the Japanese bar food and Asian-accented drinks list.",

      "description": "Planted with lavender, herbs and olive trees, this rooftop terrace at South Place Hotel brings a little piece of Provence to Moorgate — not that there’s anywhere in Provence that also affords you a bird’s eye view of the ongoing Crossrail works in the area. Call by for a drink daily from midday until 11.30pm.",

      "description": "Spread over five floors in a renovated Georgian town house, Bird of Smithfield serves excellent British food — including meat from across the way — courtesy of ex-The Ivy chef Alan Bird. More to the point, it comes with a rooftop terrace bar offering great views across the top of the meat market and beyond. It has a strict 11.30pm curfew, after which time an underground cocktail bar takes over.",
